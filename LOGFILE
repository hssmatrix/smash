Change kmpdos for generalized eigenvalue problems
Modify the lucky breakdown in Lanczos algorithms
Modify the drivers for new evsl structures
Create a new folder called MATRICES which includes one stiffness matrix and one mass matrix obtained from 3D FEM discretization

Feb 9, 2017. RL
Add features of matrix-free solvers and generalized eigenvalue problems.
Changed all 5 solvers accordingly for these two features.
Add file evsl.c mainly for these two features.
Add file suitesparse.c for solving systems with A-SIGMA B and factoring B with
the default solver.
Add some new required routines in spmat.c
Rename TESTS-Gen to TEST-Mat for general matrices
Creating TESTS-Gen for generalized e.v problem. 
Test programs for gen e.v of 2 solvers added: Poly+TR, Rational+NonRestart,
only testing with Laplacians (A,B are both Laplacians). 
Need drivers for other solvers and for general matrices.
Merge makefileR and makefileP into one.
In test drivers for rational filters, all directly solvers stuff were deleted.
Those drivers were lengthy and hard to follow. In the new drivers, we only show how to
use the default solvers when EVSL is compiled with SuiteSparse. 
The driver is much cleaner. We may give one example later to show 
how to use a user-provided solver. But this may have already been clear.
--All above changes were pushed to git branch ruipeng_dev.

 put in the Doxigen files + Doxygen commented files [thanks Luke!]
 reconled some changes with the files used by Luke. 
 removed Laplacean related files from SRC and put them in the 
 TESTS_Lap directory under lapl.c
 TODO: the documentation (doxygen) excludes INC TESTS_Lap and TESTS_Gen
       Add those in soon. Need to document files. and 
       remove EXCLUDE command from file Documentation/Doxyfile

Mon Aug 15 15:50:00 CDT 2016: 1) fixed a bug in chebpoly that affected
 jackson damping. 2) reorganized the parameters pf the pol. filters into
 a struct. called polparams .. 3) coded a non-restart lanczos filter
 procedure. 4) recoded the ChebAv routines to improve speed as well as
 clarity. YS 

Fri Jul 1 15:00:45 CDT 2016 change rand_double() so it returns numbers
 between -1  and 1 with mean  0.  and removed the  lines in spslicer.c
 that enforce  the mean  to be  zero. 
 added a function  (time_seeder()) to generate a seed  for srand based
 on the timer/ changed spslicer accordingly..
 more cleaning  in TEST.

Thu Jun 30 10:59:52 CDT 2016 -- YS

  fixed an error in testL.c so that it can also work for 3D problems.
  changed the README files according to changes made recently..

Wed Jun 29 18:10:51 CDT 2016 -- YS
 -- removed test0.c .. and changed testL.c so you can enter
    some parameters on the command line. (as done initially by Yuanzhe I think)

 -- made a small change to slicer so it treats the particular case of one slice.
    


Mon Nov 23 11:22:30 CST 2015 -- YX

 -- the format of matfile has changed
 
 -- lanblan.* chebsi.* have changed. 
    The outputs of these functions are written to OUT/ for each matrix
    
 -- testG.c testSi.c have changed accordingly. 
  

Fri Nov 20 11:18:30 CST 2015 -- YS

 -- changed chebpoly -- new functions for selecting 
    filters/

 -- There were two io.c files (!) one is SRC and one in TESTS.
    removed unnecessary items in SRC/io.c and renamed it dumps.c

 -- changes to the way a matrix is entered have been made by 
    yuanzhe. io.h has changed accordingly.. 

 -- in DKGS reorth. You do not need more that 1 reortho.
    [Kahane's ``twice is enough"]

 
Wed Nov 11 14:29:44 PST 2015
-- changed CGS reortho, now with the DGKS test


Sat Oct 31 16:14:32 CDT 2015  -- YS
 -- changed the makefiles so as to allow compiling on macs
 -- updated slightly the readme files.
